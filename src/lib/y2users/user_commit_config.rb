module Y2Users
  # Class for configuring the commit action for a user
  #
  # Writers can receive a collection of objects of this class (see {UserCommitConfigCollection}) in
  # order to decide what actions to perform over the user. For example, a writer can use the commit
  # config to check whether the content of the home directory should be moved or not.
  # TODO: It is confusing to have config for different commit actions, so for future it makes sense
  # to split it
  class UserCommitConfig
    # Name of the user this commit config applies to
