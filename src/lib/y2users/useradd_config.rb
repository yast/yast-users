module Y2Users
  # Class to represent the configuration of useradd
  #
  # Most attributes correspond to the so-called default values managed by "useradd -D" and
  # traditionally stored at /etc/default/useradd, but there can be exceptions. For example, the
  # attribute "umask" is handled by this class because it was originally a regular useradd
  # default value. If in doubt, check the documentation of each attribute.
  #
  # Attributes can be nil to indicate the value is unknown or irrelevant. That can happen if the
  # UseraddConfig object is constructed from an AutoYaST profile.
  #
  # When creating users in the target system, the configuration is written into that system in
  # advance to make it available for useradd. Note that only the attributes listed at
  # {.writable_attributes} will be actually persisted to the target system at that point. That is,
  # those are the only default values that can really be changed in the corresponding UseraddConfig
  # object to affect how the users are created and, thus, are the only ones with defined setters.
  #
  # As a software design decision, attributes that correspond to a key at /etc/default/useradd are
  # writable only if they can be changed via "adduser -D". For example, "skel" is not writable
  # because the support to adjust its value via "adduser -D" was removed at some point during the
  # useradd lifecycle (it was possible to adjust it in version 3.x but not in 4.x).
  #
  # Many of the attributes in this class have their counterpart in the <user_defaults> section of
  # the AutoYaST profile. But note there is not a 1:1 relationship, check {Autoinst::Reader} for
  # more information.
